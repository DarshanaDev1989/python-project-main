This is a simple Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application and GUI application  designed to help a local chicken breeder move from a paper-based chicken record system to a basic digital record-keeping solution. The application serves as a Proof of Concept (POC) for managing chicken records locally using a Python list and optional file storage (CSV or text files).

The system is designed to run on Microsoft Windows or macOS and allows users to interact with chicken data using a simple terminal menu.
